% !!  Steady-state version of an equation.

%     FullEquation !! SteadyStateEquation;
%
% Description
% ============
%
% For each transition or measurement equation, you can provide a separate
% steady-state version of it. The steady-state version is used when you run
% the functions [`sstate`](model/sstate) and
% [`chksstate`](model/chksstate), the latter unless you change the option
% `'eqtn='`. This is useful when you can substantially simplify some parts
% of the full dynamic equations, and help therefore the numerical solver to
% achieve faster and possibly laso more accurate results.
%
% Why is a double exclamation point, `!!`, used to start the steady-state
% versions of equations? Because if you associate your model file
% extension(s) (such as `'mod'` or `'model'`) with the Matlab editor,
% anything after an exclamation point is displayed red making it easier to
% spot the steady-state equations.
%
% Example
% ========
%
% The following steady state version will be, of course, valid only in
% stationary models where we can safely remove lags and leads.
%
%     Lambda = Lambda{1}*(1+r)*beta !! r = 1/beta - 1;
%
% Example
% ========
%
%     log(A) = log(A{-1}) + epsilon_a !! A = 1;
