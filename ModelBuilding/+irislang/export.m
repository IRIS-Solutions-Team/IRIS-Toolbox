% Description
% ============
%
% You can include in the model file the contents of files you need or want
% to carry around together with the model; a typical example is your own
% m-file functions used in model equations.
%
% The file or files are created and saved under the name specified in the
% `!export` keyword at the time you load the model using the function
% [`model`](model/model). The contents of the export files is are also
% stored within the model objects. You can manually re-create and re-save
% all exportable files by running the function [`export`](model/export).
%
% If no filename is provided or `FileName` is empty, an error is thrown.
