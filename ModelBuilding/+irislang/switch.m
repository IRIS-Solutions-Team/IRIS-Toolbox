%
% Description
% ============
%
% The `!switch...!case...!otherwise...!end` command works the same way as
% its counterpart in the Matlab programming language.
% 
% Use the `!switch...!case...!end` command to create a larger number of
% branches of the model code. Which block of code is actually read in and
% which blocks are discarded depends on which value in the `!case` clauses
% matches the value of the `!switch` expression. This works exactly as the
% `switch...case...end` command in Matlab. The expression after the `!switch`
% part of the command must must be a valid Matlab expression, and can refer
% to the model parameters, or to other fields included in the parameter
% database passed in when you run the [`model`](model/model) function;
% see [the option `'assign='`](model/model).
% 
% If the expression fails to be matched by any value in the `!case`
% clauses, the branch in the `!otherwise` clause is used. If it is a
% `!switch` command without the `!otherwise` clause, the whole command is
% discarded. The Matlab function `isequal` is used to match the `!switch`
% expression with the `!case` values.
% 
% Example
% ========
% 
%     !switch policy_regime
%   
%         !case 'IT'
%             r = rho*r{-1} + (1-rho)*kappa*pie{4} + epsilon;
%   
%         !case 'Managed_exchange_rate'
%             s = s{-1} + epsilon;
%   
%         !case 'Constant_money_growth'
%             m-m{-1} = m{-1}-m{-2} + epsilon;
%        
%     !end
% 
% When reading the model file in, create a parameter database, include at
% least a field named `policy_regime` in it, and use the option `'assign='`
% to pass the database in. Note that you do not need to declare
% `policy_regime` as a parameter in the model file.
% 
%     P = struct( );
%     P.policy_regime = 'Managed_exchange_rate';
%     ...
%     m = model('my.model','assign',P);
% 
% In this case, the managed exchange rate policy rule, `s = s{-1} +
% epsilon;` is read in and the rest of the `!switch` command is discarded.
% To use another branch of the `!switch` command you need to re-read the
% model file again with a different value assigned to the `policy_regime`
% field of the input database.
