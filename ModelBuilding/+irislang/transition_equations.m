% Description
% ============
%
% The `!transition_equations` keyword starts a new block of transition
% equations (i.e. endogenous equations); the equations can stretch over
% multiple lines and must be separated by semi-colons. You can have as many
% equation blocks as you wish in any order in your model file: They all
% get combined together when you read the model file in.
% 
% You can add descriptive labels to the equations (in single or double
% quotes, preceding the equation); these will be stored in, and
% accessible from, the model object.
%
% Example
% ========

%     !transition_equations
%         'Euler equation' C{1}/C = R*beta;
