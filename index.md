The Iris Toolbox is a macroeconomic modeling package for
[Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com) developed by the Iris Solutions Team since
2001.

#### [:octicons-gear-24: Setup](./+setup/index.md)


IrisT provides tools to support the typical workflows in the theoretical development
and practical operation of macroeconomic models and model-based production frameworks. 
In a seamless command line oriented interface, the toolbox integrates the following four broad areas:

__[:octicons-file-diff-24: Structural modeling tools](StructuralModeling/index.md)__
>
> Tools for development, implementation, diagnosis, and operation of advanced macro
> models, including nonlinear nonstationary models with forward-looking
> (model-consistent, rational) expectations, or systems of nonlinear
> empirical equations.
>

#### [:octicons-graph-24: Time series modeling](TimeSeriesModeling/index.md)
>
> Tools for estimation, diagnosis and operation of empirical univariate and
> multivariate time series models with focus on dimension reduction, such
> as VAR, bayesian VAR or dynamic factor models.
>

#### [:octicons-database-24: Data management](DataManagement/index.md)
>
> Data management and time series processing functions optimized for use in
> practical macroeconomic models.
>

#### [:octicons-stack-24: Reporting](Reporting/index.md)
>
> Frameworks for the on-screen and HTML visualization of results.
>

Furthermore, IrisT offers a number of utility functions to make
macroeconomic modeling more convenient in Matlab:

#### [:octicons-tools-24: Utilities](Utilities/index.md)
>
> Utilities supporting the main functionality, including probabilistic
> distributions package, data visualization tools for on-screen graphics,
> text processing utilities.
