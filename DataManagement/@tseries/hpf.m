%
% __Syntax with Output Arguments Swapped__
%
% Input arguments marked with a `~` sign may be omitted.
%
%     [C, T, CutOff, Lambda] = hpf2(X, ~Range, ...)
%
%
% __Input Arguments__
%
% * `X` [ tseries ] - Input tseries object that will be filtered.
%
% * `~Range` [ numeric | char | *`@all`* ] - Date range on which the input
% data will be filtered; `Range` can be `@all`, `Inf`, `[startdata, Inf]`, 
% or `[-Inf, enddate]`; if omitted, `@all` (i.e. the entire available range
% of the input series) is used.
%
%
% __Output Arguments__
%
% * `T` [ tseries ] - Low-frequency (trend) component.
%
% * `C` [ tseries ] - High-frequency (cyclical or gap) component.
%
% * `CutOff` [ numeric ] - Cut-off periodicity; periodicities above the
% cut-off are attributed to trends, periodicities below the cut-off are
% attributed to gaps.
%
% * `Lambda` [ numeric ] - Smoothing parameter actually used; this output
% argument is useful when the option `'cutoff='` is used instead of
% `'lambda='`.
%
%
% __Options__
%
% * `'Cutoff='` [ numeric | *empty* ] - Cut-off periodicity in periods
% (depending on the time series frequency); this option can be specified
% instead of `'lambda='`; the smoothing parameter will be then determined
% based on the cut-off periodicity.
%
% * `'CutoffYear='` [ numeric | *empty* ] - Cut-off periodicity in years; this
% option can be specified instead of `'lambda='`; the smoothing parameter
% will be then determined based on the cut-off periodicity.
%
% * `'Gamma='` [ numeric | tseries | *1* ] - Weight or weights on the
% deviations of the trend from observations; it only makes sense to use
% this option to make the signal-to-noise ratio time-varying; see the
% optimization problem below.
%
% * `'InfoSet='` [ `1` | *`2`* ] - Information set assumption used in the
% filter: `1` runs a one-sided filter, `2` runs a two-sided filter.
%
% * `'Lambda='` [ numeric | *`@auto`* ] - Smoothing parameter; needs
% to be specified for tseries objects with indeterminate frequency. See
% Description for default values.
%
% * `'Level='` [ tseries ] - Time series with hard tunes and soft tunes on
% the level of the trend.
%
% * `'Change='` [ tseries ] - Time series with hard tunes and soft tunes on
% the change in the trend.
%
% * `'Log='` [ `true` | *`false`* ] - Logarithmise the data before filtering, 
% de-logarithmise afterwards.
%
%
% __Description__
%
% __The Underlying Optimization Problem__
%
% The function `hpf` solves a constrained optimization problem described by
% the following Lagrangian
%
% \[
% \min_{\bar y_t, \omega_t, \sigma_t}
% \underbrace{
% \sum \lambda \left( \Delta \bar y_t - \Delta \bar y_{t-1} \right)^2
% + \sum \gamma_t \left( \bar y_t - y_t \right)^2}_\text{Plain HP with
% time-varying signal-to-noise ratio} + \cdots
% \]
% \[
% \cdots +
% \underbrace{\sum u_t \left( \bar y_t - a_t \right)^2}_\text{Soft level tunes}
% + \underbrace{\sum v_t \left( \Delta \bar y_t - b_t
% \right)^2}_\text{Soft growth tunes} +
% \underbrace{\sum \omega_t \left( \bar y_t - c_t \right)}_\text{Hard level tunes}
% + \underbrace{\sum \sigma_t \left( \Delta \bar y_t - d_t
% \right)}_\text{Hard growth tunes}, 
% \]
%
% where
% 
% * \( \Delta \) is the first-difference operator;
% * \( \lambda \) is a (scalar) smoothing parameter;
% * \( y_t \) are user-supplied observations;
% * \( \bar y_t\) is the fitted trend;
% * \( \gamma_t \) are user-supplied weights to modify the basic
% signal-to-noise ratio over time (the default setting is \(\gamma_t=1\)), 
% entered in the option `'gamma='`;
% * \( a_t \) and \( u_t \) are soft tunes on the level of the trend and the
% weights associated with these soft level tunes, respectively, entered
% together as complex numbers in the option `'Level='`;
% * \( b_t \) and \( v_t \) are soft tunes on the change in the level of the trend
% and the weights associated with these soft growth tunes, respectively, 
% entered together as complex numbers in the option `'Change='`;
% * \( c_t \) are hard tunes on the level of the trend, entered as real numbers
% in the option `'Level='`;
% * \( d_t \) are hard tunes on the change in the level of the trend, entered
% as real numbers in the option `'Change='`;
% * \( \omega_t \) are lagRange multipliers on the hard level tunes (note that
% these are computed as part of the optimization problem, not entered by
% the user);
% * \( \sigma_t \) are lagRange multipliers on the hard growth tunes (note that
% these are computed as part of the optimization problem, not entered by
% the user).
%
% Each of the summations in the above Lagrangian goes over those periods in
% which the respective bracketed terms are defined (observations or tunes
% exist). You can combine any number of any tunes in one run of `hpf`, 
% including out-of-sample tunes (see below).
%
%
% _Imposing Tunes on Trend Level and Trend Change_
%
% * The hard tunes and soft tunes on the level of the trend are entered as
% time series through the option `'Level='`.
%
% * The hard tunes and soft tunes on the change in the trend are entered as
% time series through the option `'change='`.
%
% * In the tseries objects entered through `'Level='` and/or `'change='`, 
% you can combine any number of hard and soft tune. In each particular
% period, you can obviously specify only a hard tune or only a soft tune.
% You can think of hard tunes as a special case of soft tunes with
% infinitely large weights.
%
% * A hard tune is specified as a plain real number (i.e. a number with a
% zero complex part).
%
% * A soft tune must be entered as a complex number whose real part
% specifies the tune itself, and the imaginary part specifies the *inverse*
% of the weight, i.e. \( 1/v_t \) or \(1/u_t\), on that tune in that period. Note
% that if the weight goes to infinity, the imaginary part becomes zero and
% the tune becomes a hard tune.
%
%
% __Out-of-Sample Tunes__
% 
% Tunes can be imposed also at dates before the first observation of the
% input series, or after the last observation. In other words, the time
% series in `'Level='` and/or `'Change='` can have a more extended Range
% (at either side) than the filtered input series.
%
%
% _Default Smoothing Parameters_
%
% If the user does not specify the smoothing parameter using the
% `'Lambda='` option (or reassigns the default `@auto`), a default value is
% used. The default value is based on common practice and can be calculated
% using the date frequency of the input time series as \( \lambda = 100f
% \), where \( f \) is the frequency (yearly=1, half-yearly=2, quarterly=4,
% monthly=12). This gives the following default values:
%
% * 100 for yearly time series (cut-off periodicity of 19.79 years);
% * 400 for half-yearly time series (cut-off periodicity of 14.02 years);
% * 1,600 for quarterly time series (cut-off periodicity of 9.92 years);
% * 3,600 for bi-monthly time series (cut-off periodicity of 8.11 years);
% * 14,400 for monthly time series (cut-off periodicity of 5.73 years).
%
% Note that there is no default value for data with indeterminate or daily
% frequency: for these types of time series, you must always use the option
% `'Lambda=''.
