# !import

{== Include the content of another model file.==}

## Syntax

    !import(FileName)

## Description

The `!import` command loads the content of the specified file `FileName`.
This allows you to split the model code into several parts (each saved in
a separate file) and to reuse some bits of the model.

## Example

    !import(mesurement_equations.model)
